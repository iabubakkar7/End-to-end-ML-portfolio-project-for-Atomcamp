## Project Setup

To ensure that all Python notebooks run smoothly, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Datasets**: 
   - Place `carprices.csv` in the same directory as `data_cleaning.ipynb` for data cleaning tasks.
   - Place `data_preprocessed.csv` in the same directory as `data_training_and_dumping.ipynb` for data training and model dumping.

2. **Python Libraries**: 
   - Ensure that the following libraries are installed in your environment:
     - `pandas`
     - `numpy`
     - `gradio`
     - `statsmodels`
     - `scikit-learn`
     - `matplotlib`
     - (and any other libraries used in the notebooks)

3. **FASTAPI Deployment**: 
   - The `app.py` file contains the code for deploying the machine learning model using FASTAPI.

By following these steps, you can ensure that the notebooks and the application will work as intended.
